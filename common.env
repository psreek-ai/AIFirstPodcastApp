# This file defines paths accessible INSIDE the Docker containers.
# Services will use these variables in their own .env files.

# --- Shared Resource Paths ---
# Path for the shared SQLite database file within containers
SHARED_DATABASE_PATH=/app/database/aethercast_podcasts.db

# Standardized path for shared audio files within containers (used by AIMS_TTS, VFA, ASF, IGA)
SHARED_AUDIO_DIR_CONTAINER=/shared_audio

# --- Google Cloud Project Configuration (USER MUST SET THESE) ---
# These variables are used by services that interact with Google Cloud Platform,
# currently: AIMS (Vertex AI LLM), AIMS_TTS (Cloud TTS), and IGA (Vertex AI Imagen).
# Replace with your actual GCP Project ID and Location for Vertex AI services.
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id-here
GCP_LOCATION=your-gcp-location-here # e.g., us-central1

# --- Common Service Settings ---
FLASK_DEBUG_MODE=True # Default Flask debug mode for services

# --- Test modes (can be overridden in service-specific .env files or docker-compose environment section) ---
PSWA_TEST_MODE_ENABLED=True
VFA_TEST_MODE_ENABLED=True
USE_REAL_NEWS_API=False # For TDA, to avoid hitting external API during basic integration tests

# --- Service URLs (for inter-service communication within Docker) ---
# IGA - Image Generation Agent
IGA_SERVICE_URL_CONTAINER=http://iga:5007

# TDA - Topic Discovery Agent
TDA_SERVICE_URL_CONTAINER=http://tda:5000/discover_topics

# AIMS - AI Model Service (for LLM calls by PSWA and SCA)
AIMS_SERVICE_BASE_URL_CONTAINER=http://aims_service:8000

# AIMS_TTS - AI Model Text-to-Speech Service (for TTS calls by VFA)
AIMS_TTS_SERVICE_BASE_URL_CONTAINER=http://aims_tts_service:9000

# Note: Actual service URLs (like TDA_SERVICE_URL for API_GW, or PSWA_SERVICE_URL for CPOA)
# will be set in each service's specific .env file, referencing other service names
# as defined in docker-compose.yml (e.g., http://tda:5000).
# This common.env is more for shared *resource paths* and common settings.
# Individual service .env files will be updated to use these container paths and common settings.
# Example:
# In api_gateway/.env: DATABASE_FILE=${SHARED_DATABASE_PATH}
# In pswa/.env: PSWA_DATABASE_PATH=${SHARED_DATABASE_PATH}
#              FLASK_DEBUG=${FLASK_DEBUG_MODE}
# ...and so on for other services.
