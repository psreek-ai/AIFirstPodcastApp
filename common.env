# This file defines paths accessible INSIDE the Docker containers.
# Services will use these variables in their own .env files.

# Path for the shared SQLite database file within containers

# Standardized path for shared audio files within containers (used by AIMS_TTS, VFA, ASF)
SHARED_AUDIO_DIR_CONTAINER=/shared_audio

# Example: Define service URLs using Docker Compose service names
# These would be used by individual service .env files if they weren't already
# defaulting to localhost or specific service names.
# For instance, in api_gateway/.env, you might have:
# TDA_SERVICE_URL=http://tda:5000/discover_topics
# (assuming 'tda' is the service name in docker-compose.yml and it runs on port 5000)

# Note: Actual service URLs (like TDA_SERVICE_URL for API_GW, or PSWA_SERVICE_URL for CPOA)
# will be set in each service's specific .env file, referencing other service names
# as defined in docker-compose.yml (e.g., http://tda:5000).
# This common.env is more for shared *resource paths* like DB and audio dir.
# Individual service .env files will be updated to use these container paths.
# Example:
# In api_gateway/.env: DATABASE_FILE=${DATABASE_FILE_PATH_CONTAINER}
# In pswa/.env: PSWA_DATABASE_PATH=${DATABASE_FILE_PATH_CONTAINER}
# In tda/.env: TDA_DATABASE_PATH=${DATABASE_FILE_PATH_CONTAINER}
# In vfa/.env: VFA_SHARED_AUDIO_DIR=${SHARED_AUDIO_DIR_CONTAINER}
# In asf/.env: (ASF might not need SHARED_AUDIO_DIR directly if filepath is passed via notification)
#             However, if it does construct paths, it would use SHARED_AUDIO_DIR_CONTAINER.
#             For now, ASF gets the full path from CPOA/VFA notification.
