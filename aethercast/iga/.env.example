# --- Local Directory (Primarily for temporary files if ever needed) ---
# IGA_GENERATED_IMAGE_DIR=/shared_audio/iga_images
# Note: The final image_url will be a GCS URI (gs://...).
# This local path is less critical now but kept in config if local staging is ever re-introduced.
# Ensure this path is writable by the service if used. For Docker, it should be on a shared volume.
# Default in main.py is /shared_audio/iga_images.
