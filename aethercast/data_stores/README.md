# Data Stores in Aethercast

This document provides an overview of the data storage mechanisms currently implemented in the Aethercast system.

## Primary Data Store: SQLite

The Aethercast application primarily uses a **SQLite database** as its shared, persistent data store. This single database file (e.g., `aethercast_podcasts.db` stored in a shared Docker volume) is accessed by multiple services, including the API Gateway, CPOA, and potentially others, to store and manage:

*   **Podcast Task Information:** Tracking the lifecycle, status, and metadata of podcast generation tasks (in the `podcasts` table).
*   **Topics and Snippets:** Storing discovered topics and generated snippets (in the `topics_snippets` table).
*   **Generated Scripts:** Caching podcast scripts generated by PSWA (in the `generated_scripts` table).
*   **User Sessions and Preferences:** Managing user session identifiers and their associated preferences (in the `user_sessions` table).

### Schema Definition
The canonical SQL schema for these tables is defined within `aethercast/api_gateway/main.py` in the `DB_SCHEMA_SQL` variable. Please refer to this file or the API Gateway's README for detailed table structures and column definitions.

### Rationale
SQLite was chosen for its simplicity, ease of setup (file-based), and suitability for the current scale and development phase of the Aethercast project. It allows for a shared data layer accessible by services running within the Docker Compose environment via a shared volume.

## Future Considerations (Conceptual)
While SQLite serves the current needs, future scalability and feature enhancements might involve:
- A dedicated **NoSQL database** (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) for more flexible data modeling or larger scale content/metadata storage.
- A **Key-Value Store** (e.g., Redis) for high-performance caching of frequently accessed data or more robust session management, especially if horizontal scaling of services introduces challenges with a single SQLite file for all session data.

The detailed markdown files within this directory (e.g., `nosql_agent_task_state.md`, `key_value_store_definitions.md`) describe these conceptual future data models and stores. They should be reviewed in conjunction with the current SQLite implementation to understand the evolution of data management in Aethercast.
