This directory describes the data stores used by Aethercast.

We will use a NoSQL database for persistent data and a Key-Value store for caching and session management.

- **NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB/DynamoDB):** For storing structured and semi-structured data related to content and application state.
- **Key-Value Store (e.g., Redis):** For fast access to frequently used data and session information.
