# AI Model Serving (AIMS) - TTS Placeholder

This directory describes the placeholder for the AI Model Serving infrastructure responsible for Text-to-Speech (TTS) operations.

The actual AIMS_TTS would be a scalable service hosting various TTS models and voices. For now, this placeholder defines the expected API contract.

The primary consumers of this service will be the `SnippetCraftAgent` (for generating audio previews of snippets) and the `VoiceForgeAgent` (for generating full podcast audio from scripts).
