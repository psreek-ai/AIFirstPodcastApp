# AIMS (TTS) - API Placeholder

This document defines the API contract for the placeholder Text-to-Speech (TTS) service.

## Endpoint: `/v1/synthesize`

### Method
POST

### Request Body
```json
{
  "text": "string", // The text to synthesize into speech
  "voice_id": "string", // Identifier for the desired voice (e.g., "AetherVoice-Nova", "AetherVoice-Echo")
  "output_format": "string", // Desired audio format (e.g., "mp3", "aac", "pcm")
  "speech_rate": "float", // Optional: Speed of speech (e.g., 1.0 for normal, 0.8 for slower)
  "pitch": "float", // Optional: Pitch adjustment (e.g., 1.0 for normal)
  "response_type": "string" // "url" or "stream". "url" returns a URL to the audio. "stream" would be for direct streaming (more complex, placeholder might just simulate with a URL).
}
```

### Success Response (Status Code: 200 OK)

#### For `response_type: "url"`
```json
{
  "request_id": "string", // Unique ID for this synthesis request
  "voice_id": "string", // Voice used
  "audio_url": "string", // URL to the generated audio file
  "audio_duration_seconds": "float", // Duration of the audio in seconds
  "audio_format": "string" // Format of the audio
}
```
**Hardcoded Placeholder Response (for `response_type: "url"`):**
```json
{
  "request_id": "aims-tts-placeholder-req-456",
  "voice_id": "AetherVoice-Placeholder",
  "audio_url": "https://aethercast.com/placeholder_audio/sample.mp3", // This URL is fictional
  "audio_duration_seconds": 2.5,
  "audio_format": "mp3"
}
```
*Note: For the placeholder, a single, very short, generic pre-recorded audio file (e.g., saying "Aethercast placeholder audio") could be hosted at `https://aethercast.com/placeholder_audio/sample.mp3`. If hosting is not possible, this URL will just be a non-functional placeholder string.*

#### For `response_type: "stream"`
The response would be a direct audio stream (e.g., `audio/mpeg`). The placeholder will likely not implement actual streaming but could return a JSON response indicating it would stream if it were the real service.

**Hardcoded Placeholder Response (simulating `response_type: "stream"` by returning URL):**
```json
{
  "request_id": "aims-tts-placeholder-req-789",
  "voice_id": "AetherVoice-Placeholder",
  "message": "Stream would begin if this were the actual AIMS_TTS service. For placeholder, use the sample URL.",
  "simulated_stream_audio_url": "https://aethercast.com/placeholder_audio/sample.mp3",
  "audio_duration_seconds": 2.5,
  "audio_format": "mp3"
}
```

### Error Response (Status Code: 4xx/5xx)
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "string", // e.g., "invalid_request_error", "tts_failure"
    "message": "string"
  }
}
```
