# AI Model Serving (AIMS) - LLM Placeholder

This directory describes the placeholder for the AI Model Serving infrastructure responsible for Large Language Model (LLM) operations.

The actual AIMS would be a scalable service hosting various LLMs. For now, this placeholder defines the expected API contract.

The primary consumers of this service will be the `SnippetCraftAgent` (for generating snippet text) and the `PodcastScriptWeaverAgent` (for generating full podcast scripts).
