# Topic Discovery Agent (TDA)

The Topic Discovery Agent (TDA) is responsible for identifying potential podcast topics from various data sources.

## Key Responsibilities:

1.  **Data Source Scanning:** Periodically (or on-demand) scans configured data sources such as news APIs, RSS feeds, research paper aggregators, and trending topic platforms. (Initially, this will be simulated with hardcoded data).
2.  **Content Ingestion & Preprocessing:** Fetches content from these sources and performs initial preprocessing like text extraction and metadata parsing.
3.  **Topic Identification:** Employs techniques (e.g., NLP, keyword analysis, clustering - initially simplified) to identify emerging themes, significant events, or interesting subjects that could form the basis of a podcast topic.
4.  **Topic Enrichment:** Gathers additional metadata for identified topics, such as potential keywords, related articles/sources, and a preliminary summary.
5.  **Relevance Ranking:** Assigns a relevance score to each potential topic based on factors like timeliness, source credibility, and alignment with Aethercast's content strategy (initially, this will be a basic scoring mechanism).
6.  **Output Formatting:** Provides a list of `TopicObjects` to the Central Podcast Orchestrator Agent (CPOA), which can then be used for snippet generation or further processing.

## Integration:

*   **Called by:** Central Podcast Orchestrator Agent (CPOA) via an API endpoint (e.g., `POST /discover_topics`).
*   **Output:** A list of `TopicObject` data structures.

This directory contains the source code and any specific configuration for the TDA service.
For now, it will be a simple Python-based service (e.g., using Flask) that simulates these responsibilities with hardcoded data and basic logic.
