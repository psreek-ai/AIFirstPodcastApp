## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document provides a detailed description of the agent orchestration layer within the Aethercast system. The orchestration layer, primarily embodied by the **Central Podcast Orchestrator Agent (CPOA)**, is responsible for managing and coordinating the various specialized AI agents to achieve the dynamic generation of podcast snippets and full episodes.

The purpose of this document is to define:
* The core responsibilities and decision-making logic of the CPOA.
* The workflows for key content generation processes.
* Communication protocols and data flow between agents.
* Strategies for task management, state management, error handling, and scalability.

Effective orchestration is paramount to delivering the real-time, AI-first experience envisioned in the Aethercast manifesto.

## 2. Core Responsibilities of the Central Podcast Orchestrator Agent (CPOA)

The CPOA acts as the central nervous system and primary decision-maker for the Aethercast application. Its responsibilities are derived from the principles outlined in `01_AI_First_Agentic_System_Requirements.md#1.2` and `03_Podcast_App_Manifesto.md#2`.

* **Request Interpretation & Validation:**
    * Receives user requests (e.g., load landing page, play podcast snippet) from the API Gateway.
    * Validates requests for necessary parameters and permissions (if applicable).
    * Interprets user intent to initiate the appropriate workflow.
* **Workflow Management & Execution:**
    * Defines and manages multi-step workflows for various generation tasks.
    * Sequences asynchronous agent invocations (Celery tasks for TDA, WCHA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA, AIMS, AIMS_TTS) and handles their responses (typically by polling task status).
    * Ensures correct order and dependency management for agent tasks.
* **Task Delegation & Assignment:**
    * Identifies the appropriate specialized AI agent for each step.
    * Formats and dispatches task instructions to agents, including input data, parameters, context, and idempotency headers.
* **Agent Communication Facilitation & Idempotency Propagation:**
    * Primarily communicates with backend agents (TDA, WCHA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA, AIMS, AIMS_TTS) by dispatching Celery tasks or making HTTP calls that trigger Celery tasks.
    * Receives `X-Idempotency-Key` and `X-Workflow-ID` (optional) from its caller (e.g., API Gateway).
    * Passes these headers to the Celery tasks of the backend agents (or includes the keys in payloads). CPOA's own generated `workflow_id` (from `workflow_instances` table) is typically used as the `X-Workflow-ID` value for downstream calls, ensuring end-to-end traceability and linking idempotency records to the overarching CPOA workflow.
* **State Management:**
    * Manages its own workflow and task instance states in a PostgreSQL database (see section 6).
    * Maintains user session state (via API Gateway context).
    * Tracks the state of ongoing agent tasks and workflows (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed, failed).
    * Manages global context relevant to orchestration (e.g., availability of AI models, trending topics).
* **Data Aggregation & Transformation:**
    * Collects outputs from various specialized agents.
    * Transforms or aggregates data as needed to serve as input for subsequent agents or for the final response to the user.
* **Error Handling, Retries, and Fallbacks:**
    * Monitors agents for successful completion of tasks.
    * Implements strategies for handling errors, timeouts, or failures from specialized agents or external dependencies (e.g., web content fetching).
    * Manages retry logic and fallback procedures to ensure system resilience and a graceful user experience.
* **Monitoring & Logging:**
    * Logs key orchestration events, agent interactions, and workflow progress for debugging, auditing, and performance analysis.
    * Provides hooks or data for external monitoring systems.
* **Resource Management (High-Level):**
    * While not directly managing infrastructure, the CPOA's efficiency impacts resource utilization. It may provide signals for scaling AI model serving infrastructure based on demand patterns.
* **Extensibility Point:**
    * Designed to allow for the addition of new specialized agents or modification of existing workflows with minimal disruption.

## 3. Orchestration Workflows

The CPOA executes several key workflows. These workflows are dynamic and may evolve, but the core sequences are outlined below.

### 3.1. Workflow: Landing Page Snippet Generation & Display

* **Trigger:** User request to load the Aethercast landing page (received via API Gateway).
* **Goal:** Populate the landing page with fresh, relevant, AI-generated podcast snippets.

* **Steps:**
    1.  **CPOA: Receive Request:** CPOA receives the landing page request.
    2.  **CPOA: Initiate Topic Discovery (Optional/Periodic):**
        * CPOA dispatches an asynchronous Celery task to `TopicDiscoveryAgent` (passing `X-Idempotency-Key` and `X-Workflow-ID` if available from the initial request) to identify N fresh/trending/relevant topics.
        * `TopicDiscoveryAgent` (Celery task): Scans sources and returns a task ID. CPOA polls this task.
        * Upon successful completion of TDA task: TDA returns a list of potential topics.
        * CPOA: Stores/updates these topics in its PostgreSQL database (`topics_snippets` table).
    3.  **CPOA: Select Topics for Snippets:** (As before)
    4.  **CPOA: Delegate Snippet Crafting (Parallel for multiple snippets):**
        * For each selected topic, CPOA dispatches an asynchronous Celery task to `SnippetCraftAgent` (passing topic, `X-Idempotency-Key`, and its own `workflow_id` as `X-Workflow-ID`).
        * `SnippetCraftAgent` (Celery task):
            * (Optional) Briefly consults `WebContentHarvesterAgent` (as a library function call from within its task) for minimal context if needed.
            * Utilizes LLMs (via AIMS service) to generate snippet text and a `cover_art_prompt`.
            * Returns a task ID. CPOA polls this task.
        * Upon successful completion of SCA task: SCA returns the `SnippetDataObject` (with `cover_art_prompt`) to CPOA.
    5.  **CPOA: Delegate Image Generation (In parallel with or after Snippet Crafting):**
        * For each `SnippetDataObject` containing a `cover_art_prompt`, CPOA dispatches an asynchronous Celery task to `ImageGenerationAgent` (IGA) (passing the prompt, `X-Idempotency-Key`, and `X-Workflow-ID`).
        * `ImageGenerationAgent` (Celery task): Generates image via Vertex AI, uploads to GCS. Returns a task ID. CPOA polls this task.
        * Upon successful completion of IGA task: IGA returns the GCS URI of the image. CPOA updates the `SnippetDataObject` with this `image_url`.
    6.  **CPOA: Aggregate Snippets:** CPOA collects all generated and augmented `SnippetDataObjects`.
    7.  **CPOA: Generate UI Definition:**
        *   CPOA takes the aggregated list of `SnippetDataObjects` (now including GCS image URIs) and any other relevant context.
        *   CPOA calls the `DynamicUIAgent (DUIA)` logic/module with this content and context, requesting a UI definition for the "landingPage" view (or equivalent).
        *   `DynamicUIAgent`: Constructs the UI Definition JSON based on the provided data and defined strategies (e.g., programmatic construction using the schema from `docs/architecture/Dynamic_UI_Schema.md`).
        *   `DynamicUIAgent`: Returns the UI Definition JSON to CPOA.
    7.  **CPOA: Send UI Definition to Frontend:**
        *   CPOA sends the UI Definition JSON to the `API Gateway (APIGW)`.
        *   `API Gateway`: Forwards the UI Definition JSON as the response to the `Frontend UI (FEND)`.
        *   `Frontend UI`: Parses this JSON and renders the UI components dynamically.
        *   *(Note: The optional image generation via IGA would typically occur as part of step 4, where SnippetCraftAgent provides a prompt, and CPOA orchestrates the IGA call before calling DUIA).*

### 3.2. Workflow: On-Demand Full Podcast Generation

* **Trigger:** User clicks "Listen" on a podcast snippet or initiates a request for a podcast on a specific topic via API Gateway.
* **Goal:** Generate and make available a full podcast episode. The generation involves multiple asynchronous, idempotent Celery tasks.

* **Steps:**
    1.  **FEND/Client: Request Podcast:** Client sends request to API Gateway (`POST /api/v1/podcasts`) with topic details and `X-Idempotency-Key` / `X-Workflow-ID` headers.
    2.  **APIGW: Route Request:** API Gateway forwards to CPOA, including headers and user context.
    3.  **CPOA: Receive & Validate Request:** CPOA validates, creates a master `workflow_instance` in PostgreSQL.
    4.  **CPOA: Initiate Web Content Harvesting (Library Call):**
        * `CPOA` calls `WebContentHarvesterAgent` (WCHA) library functions directly to fetch and process content for the topic. This step is synchronous within the CPOA's initial processing before dispatching long-running tasks.
        * `WCHA`: Returns harvested content to CPOA.
    5.  **CPOA: Initiate Podcast Script Weaving (Async Celery Task):**
        * `CPOA` dispatches `weave_script_task` to `PodcastScriptWeaverAgent` (PSWA) with harvested content, topic, persona, and relevant idempotency headers (`X-Idempotency-Key` for PSWA task, CPOA's `workflow_id` as `X-Workflow-ID`).
        * PSWA (Celery task) returns a task ID. CPOA polls for completion.
        * `PSWA`: Checks cache, else calls AIMS (LLM) for script generation. Stores result in idempotency table. Returns `PodcastScript`.
    6.  **CPOA: Initiate Voice Forging (Async Celery Task):**
        * Upon PSWA success, `CPOA` dispatches `forge_voice_task` to `VoiceForgeAgent` (VFA) with the script and voice parameters, plus idempotency headers.
        * VFA (Celery task) returns a task ID. CPOA polls.
        * `VFA`: Calls AIMS_TTS (which itself might be async and involve polling by VFA). Stores audio to GCS. Stores result in idempotency table. Returns audio metadata (GCS URI).
    7.  **CPOA: (Optional) Initiate Cover Image Generation (Async Celery Task):**
        * `CPOA` may generate a prompt from script/topic and dispatch `generate_image_vertex_ai_task` to `ImageGenerationAgent` (IGA), with idempotency headers.
        * IGA (Celery task) returns task ID. CPOA polls.
        * `IGA`: Calls Vertex AI, stores image to GCS. Stores result in idempotency table. Returns image GCS URI.
    8.  **CPOA: Finalize Workflow:** Once all tasks complete, CPOA updates its master `workflow_instance` in PostgreSQL with final status and links to artifacts (audio GCS URI, image GCS URI). The API Gateway can then provide these URIs (potentially as signed URLs) to the client via the task status endpoint.
    9.  **CPOA: Notify ASF (HTTP Call):** CPOA notifies the Audio Stream Feeder (ASF) about the new audio GCS URI and stream ID.

        CPOA->>ASF: Notify New Audio (GCS URI, StreamID)
        CPOA-->>PG_DB: Update WorkflowInstance (Completed, GCS URI)
        APIGW-->>FEND: task_id (initial response)
        Note left of FEND: Client polls task status endpoint, eventually gets GCS URI (via signed URL from APIGW)
    ```

### 3.3. Workflow: (Future) Adaptive/Interactive Podcast

* **Trigger:** User interaction during podcast playback (e.g., "tell me more about X," "skip this segment," thumbs up/down on a segment).
* **Goal:** Dynamically adapt the ongoing or subsequent podcast generation based on user feedback.
* **Details:** This is more complex and would involve:
    * Capturing fine-grained user interactions.
    * CPOA interpreting these interactions in real-time.
    * Potentially interrupting and re-tasking agents (e.g., `PodcastScriptWeaverAgent` to generate an explanatory sidebar, `TopicDiscoveryAgent` to find related sub-topics).
    * Seamlessly splicing new audio segments into the existing stream.
    * This requires more advanced state management and potentially more reactive agent capabilities.

## 4. Agent Communication Protocols

The CPOA and specialized agents will communicate using a combination of protocols, chosen for efficiency, reliability, and ease of integration.

* **Primary Communication (CPOA to/from Specialized Agents):**
    * **Asynchronous Task Dispatch (Celery):**
        * **Usage:** This is the primary method for CPOA to interact with TDA, WCHA (for its async operations), SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA, and also how agents like PSWA/SCA/VFA interact with AIMS/AIMS_TTS (which also use Celery backends). CPOA dispatches a Celery task to the respective agent's service or makes an HTTP call that triggers one.
        * **CPOA Perspective:** Calls the agent's Celery task (e.g., `discover_topics_task.delay(...)`) or HTTP endpoint with necessary parameters, including the `X-Idempotency-Key` and an `X-Workflow-ID` (typically CPOA's own `workflow_id`). It receives a Celery `AsyncResult` object containing the `task_id` (or an HTTP response with a task ID).
        * **Agent Perspective:** The Celery worker in the target service (TDA, WCHA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA, AIMS, AIMS_TTS) picks up the task. The agent performs its processing, manages its own idempotency using the provided keys and a shared PostgreSQL `idempotency_keys` table, and eventually returns a result or an error.
        * **Result Retrieval:** CPOA polls the task status using the `task_id` via the agent's `/v1/tasks/<task_id>` HTTP endpoint.
        * **Pros:** Decoupling, resilience, load balancing, non-blocking for CPOA, standardized way to handle long-running AI operations.
        * **Cons:** Requires polling or a callback mechanism (currently polling is used) to get results.
    * **Synchronous Request-Response (HTTP APIs):**
        * **Usage:** Used by CPOA for ASF notifications. WCHA is also used as a direct Python library call by CPOA for some initial content gathering, though WCHA itself can then dispatch async Celery tasks.
        * **Pros:** Simpler for direct request-reply.
        * **Cons:** Can block CPOA if the synchronous call is unexpectedly long.
* **Data Payloads:**
    * **JSON** is the standard format for request and response bodies for HTTP APIs and Celery task arguments/results.
    * Headers like `X-Idempotency-Key` and `X-Workflow-ID` are used for relevant Celery task dispatches or HTTP calls that trigger them.
* **Service Discovery:**
    * Docker Compose service names are used for inter-service HTTP communication (e.g., `http://pswa_service:5004`). Celery tasks are routed via the configured message broker (e.g., Redis).

**Decision: Asynchronous Celery tasks are the standard for interactions with TDA, WCHA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA, AIMS, and AIMS_TTS from CPOA (or via intermediate agents).** Synchronous calls are used by CPOA for ASF notifications or WCHA library usage.

## 5. Task Management & Delegation by CPOA

* **Task Definition (for Celery tasks dispatched by CPOA):**
    * Each task dispatch includes:
        * Target agent's Celery task name (e.g., `discover_topics_task`).
        * `args` and `kwargs` containing input data, parameters, and context.
        * Crucially, `idempotency_key` and `workflow_id` (as `X-Workflow-ID`) are passed within `kwargs` (or as headers to HTTP endpoints that trigger Celery tasks) to the backend agents (TDA, WCHA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA, AIMS, AIMS_TTS).
* **Task Assignment:** (As before) CPOA selects the agent and constructs parameters.
* **Task Progress Monitoring (for Celery tasks):**
    * CPOA receives a Celery `task_id` upon dispatch.
    * CPOA polls the respective service's `/v1/tasks/<task_id>` endpoint to get status (`PENDING`, `STARTED`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `RETRY`) and the final result or error.
    * The `task_instances` table within CPOA's PostgreSQL database is updated based on these polled statuses.
    * Timeout for polling is managed by CPOA for each downstream task.
* **Task Lifecycle (within CPOA's perspective for a downstream Celery task):** `DISPATCHED` -> `POLLING_ACTIVE` -> `AGENT_COMPLETED` / `AGENT_FAILED`. This maps to updating the `task_instances` table.
* **Agent Selection (Future):** (As before)

## 6. State Management within CPOA

Effective state management is crucial for orchestration. CPOA uses a **PostgreSQL database** for robust state persistence.

* **User Session State:** (As before - managed by API Gateway, context passed to CPOA)
* **Workflow/Task Instance State (PostgreSQL):**
    * **Storage:** This is implemented using two primary PostgreSQL tables: `workflow_instances` and `task_instances`. This same PostgreSQL database also hosts the shared `idempotency_keys` table, used by TDA, WCHA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA, AIMS, and AIMS_TTS.
    * **`workflow_instances`**: (As before) Stores high-level workflow information. The `workflow_id` from this table is used as the `X-Workflow-ID` when CPOA calls downstream services.
    * **`task_instances`**: (As before) Stores details for each agent call (now primarily Celery task dispatches). It records the Celery `task_id` received from the agent, the polled status, and eventually the summary of the result or error.
    * **Purpose:** (As before) Tracking, recovery, debugging, observability. (See `docs/architecture/CPOA_State_Management.md`).
* **Global Orchestration State:**
    * **Content:** Availability/status of specialized agents or underlying models (e.g., AIMS health), rate limits for external APIs, cached popular topics, blacklisted sources. This now also includes awareness of the PostgreSQL database health for CPOA state and shared idempotency.

**Key Principles for State Management:**
* **Minimal Sharing:** (As before)
* **Persistence for Critical Workflow State:** (As before, in PostgreSQL).
* **Standardized Formats:** (As before, JSON).

## 7. Data Flow Management

CPOA orchestrates the flow of data between the user (via API Gateway), itself, and specialized agents.

* **User Request -> CPOA:** Via API Gateway, typically small JSON payloads, potentially including `X-Idempotency-Key` and `X-Workflow-ID` headers which are extracted by the API Gateway and passed to CPOA.
* **CPOA -> Specialized Agent (Celery Task Dispatch):**
    * Celery task messages include arguments (`args`, `kwargs`) containing input data (JSON).
    * `kwargs` will include `idempotency_key` and `workflow_id` (CPOA's own `workflow_id` used as `X-Workflow-ID`) for agents that support this pattern (TDA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA).
* **Specialized Agent (Celery Task) -> CPOA (via Polling):**
    * Agent's Celery task returns results (JSON) or exceptions.
    * CPOA polls the agent's `/v1/tasks/<celery_task_id>` HTTP endpoint to get these results.
* **Large Data Objects:** (As before) References are preferred over large direct payloads in task messages. WCHA, being a library, returns data directly to CPOA.

## 8. Error Handling, Retries, and Fallbacks by CPOA

Robust error handling is vital.

* **Types of Errors CPOA Must Handle:**
    * **Agent Unavailability:** Specialized agent instance not responding or not found.
    * **Task Execution Failure within Agent:** Agent reports an error during its processing (e.g., LLM API error, TTS failure, web scraping blocked).
    * **Invalid Output from Agent:** Agent returns data that doesn't conform to expected schema or quality.
    * **Timeout:** Agent takes too long to complete a task.
    * **External Dependency Failure:** `WebContentHarvesterAgent` cannot access critical web sources.
    * **CPOA Internal Errors.**
* **Error Detection:**
    * Monitoring HTTP status codes or gRPC error codes for synchronous calls.
    * Consuming dedicated "task failure" messages or error events from asynchronous agents.
    * Implementing health checks for specialized agents.
* **Retry Strategies (for transient errors):**
    * **Configurable Retries:** For specific agents or task types, define max retry attempts.
    * **Exponential Backoff:** Increase delay between retries to avoid overwhelming a struggling service (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s).
    * **Jitter:** Add randomness to backoff delays to prevent thundering herd problems.
    * **Idempotency for Retries:** When CPOA retries dispatching a Celery task to TDA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, or VFA due to a transient error (e.g., temporary agent unavailability before task acceptance, or a network issue during dispatch polling), it **must** use the same `X-Idempotency-Key` (and `X-Workflow-ID`) as the original attempt. This allows the downstream agent to correctly identify it as a retry and avoid reprocessing if the original task eventually succeeded or is already in progress. The agent's `on_failure` handler for Celery tasks also updates the idempotency record to "failed", allowing CPOA to know a retry is for a previously failed operation.
* **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** (As before)
* **Fallback Mechanisms:** (As before)
* **Dead Letter Queues (DLQs):** (As before, for Celery tasks dispatched by CPOA).

## 9. Scalability and Concurrency of CPOA

* **CPOA Architecture:** (As before - CPOA logic is part of API Gateway, which can be scaled; PostgreSQL for state).
* **Asynchronous Operations:** (As before - Celery tasks for backend agents are key).
* **Scalable Specialized Agents:** (As before - individual services with their Flask apps and Celery workers scale independently).
* **Database Scalability:** The PostgreSQL database used for CPOA state and shared idempotency records must be scalable.
* **Concurrency Control:** (As before - CPOA workflow instances manage their own state; idempotency helps manage concurrent requests at agent level).

## 10. Extensibility

The orchestration framework should be designed for future growth.

* **Agent Registration/Discovery:** (As before)
* **Modular Workflow Definitions:** (As before)
* **Standardized Agent Interface:** (As before - Celery task signatures, HTTP polling endpoints, use of `X-Idempotency-Key` for async idempotent agents).
* **Versioning:** (As before)

## 11. Decision-Making Logic within CPOA

Beyond simple workflow execution, CPOA might incorporate more advanced decision-making:

* **Dynamic Agent Selection (Advanced):** Based on current load, agent capabilities, or even A/B testing different agent implementations.
* **Content Prioritization/Filtering:** Deciding which discovered topics are most promising, or which generated snippets meet a quality threshold before display.
* **Adaptive Workflow Branching:** Based on intermediate results from an agent, CPOA might decide to take different paths in a workflow (e.g., if initial web content is sparse, trigger a deeper search or an alternative topic).
* **Resource Optimization:** (Future) Making cost-aware decisions, e.g., choosing a less expensive LLM for less critical tasks or during off-peak hours.

This logic can be implemented using:
* Rule-based systems.
* Configuration parameters.
* Potentially, a small, dedicated AI model within CPOA for meta-decisions (though this adds complexity). It's generally better to keep the orchestration logic explicit and debuggable. (Ref: "Structure agent decisions" from Botpress).

## 12. Logging, Monitoring, and Debugging

Comprehensive observability is crucial.

* **Centralized Logging:**
    * All agents, including CPOA (via API Gateway logging), should log to a centralized logging system.
    * Logs should include `workflow_id` (from CPOA), agent-specific `task_id` (Celery task ID for downstream services), `idempotency_key` where applicable, `user_session_id`, agent name, timestamp, log level, and detailed messages.
    * Polling logs within CPOA are designed to be rich in context, including CPOA's internal task identifiers, the polled service's task ID, and specific error messages or response snippets from the downstream service to facilitate easier debugging of inter-agent communication issues.
* **Distributed Tracing:** (As before - trace context should include these IDs).
* **Metrics Monitoring:** (As before - include metrics related to idempotent operations, e.g., tasks created vs. completed, idempotency conflicts).
* **Workflow Visualization (Advanced):** (As before - CPOA's PostgreSQL state is key).
* **Alerting:** (As before)

## 13. Security Considerations

* **Inter-Agent Communication Security:** (As before - TLS for HTTP, secure Celery broker).
* **Authentication & Authorization for CPOA:** (As before - CPOA logic runs within authenticated API Gateway context).
* **Credential Management:** (As before - PostgreSQL credentials, AIMS keys, etc., via secrets management).
* **Input Validation:** (As before - including validation of `X-Idempotency-Key` format if strict rules apply, though currently it's client-defined).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** (As before).

This document provides a detailed blueprint for the `Agent_Orchestration.md`. It will need to be a living document, updated as Aethercast evolves.
