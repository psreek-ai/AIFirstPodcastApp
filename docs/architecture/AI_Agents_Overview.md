# AI_Agents_Overview.md

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the specialized AI agents that form the core operational workforce of the Aethercast system. Each agent is designed with a specific set of responsibilities and capabilities, contributing to the overall goal of dynamically generating and delivering AI-driven podcast content. These agents are coordinated by the Central Podcast Orchestrator Agent (CPOA), as detailed in `docs/architecture/Agent_Orchestration.md`.

The purpose of this document is to serve as a reference for understanding the role, functionality, inputs, outputs, and key characteristics of each agent.

## 2. General Agent Principles

All specialized AI agents within the Aethercast ecosystem adhere to the following general principles:

* **Single Responsibility (Largely):** Each agent focuses on a well-defined set of tasks.
* **Orchestrated Interaction:** Agents primarily interact via the CPOA.
* **Statelessness (Task-Level):** For their core processing, agents aim to be stateless, receiving necessary context from CPOA. State related to long-running asynchronous tasks (e.g., for idempotency or retries) is managed externally, typically in a database (like PostgreSQL for idempotency).
* **Standardized Communication:** Agents use defined data formats (JSON) and protocols (HTTP APIs, Celery tasks). Asynchronous tasks (TDA, SCA, PSWA, IGA, VFA) accept an `X-Idempotency-Key` header for idempotent operations.
* **Error Reporting:** Agents provide structured error information to CPOA, and Celery tasks use `on_failure` handlers to update idempotency records.
* **Scalability:** Agents (Flask app + Celery workers) are designed as containerized microservices for independent scalability.

## 3. Specialized AI Agent Profiles

### 3.1. Agent Name: `TopicDiscoveryAgent` (TDA)

* **Purpose/Mission:** To autonomously identify and propose relevant, engaging, and timely topics suitable for AI-generated podcast snippets and full episodes. TDA's primary operation (`discover_topics_task`) is asynchronous (Celery-based) and idempotent, using an `X-Idempotency-Key` provided by the client (via CPOA) and a shared PostgreSQL database for state tracking.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Dispatches a Celery sub-task (`fetch_news_from_newsapi_task`) to scan and analyze configured external data sources (e.g., NewsAPI.org) or uses simulated data if configured.
    * Processes fetched articles to identify emerging trends, significant events, or interesting subject matter.
    * Filters and ranks potential topics.
    * Saves discovered `TopicObject`s to a PostgreSQL database (`topics_snippets` table).
    * Returns a structured list of proposed topics to the CPOA.
* **Core AI Models/Techniques Relied Upon:**
    * External News APIs.
    * NLP for text analysis (if further processing were added).
* **Inputs:**
    * Task request from CPOA (including `X-Idempotency-Key`, `X-Workflow-ID`).
    * Query parameters (keywords, limit).
    * Configuration: News API credentials, default keywords/language.
    * Configuration: Criteria for topic selection (e.g., recency, specific categories, exclusion lists).
    * (Future) Feedback data on previously suggested topics.
* **Outputs:**
    * To CPOA: A structured list of `TopicObjects`. Each `TopicObject` may include:
        * `topic_id`: Unique identifier.
        * `title_suggestion`: A concise, descriptive title for the topic.
        * `summary`: A brief explanation of the topic.
        * `keywords`: Relevant keywords.
        * `potential_sources`: List of URLs or references to initial relevant information.
        * `relevance_score` or `priority_ranking` (optional).
        * `timestamp_discovered`.
    * Format: JSON array of `TopicObject`s.
* **Primary Interactions:**
    * Tasked by: CPOA (receives `X-Idempotency-Key`).
    * Outputs to: CPOA (returns task ID for its Celery task; results are polled).
    * Database: Stores topics in PostgreSQL (`topics_snippets` table) and uses `idempotency_keys` table (PostgreSQL).
    * Calls: Potentially `fetch_news_from_newsapi_task` (internal Celery task), which calls external News APIs.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)/Success Metrics:**
    * Relevance and engagement potential of suggested topics.
    * Novelty and diversity of topics.
    * Coverage of configured areas of interest.
    * Processing time per discovery cycle.
* **Error Scenarios & Handling:**
    * External API failures (e.g., rate limits, unavailability): Report error to CPOA, potentially with retry information. May proceed with data from other available sources.
    * Inability to parse or process content from sources: Log the issue, skip the problematic source/content, report to CPOA.
    * No new topics found: Report to CPOA.
* **Scalability Considerations:**
    * Can be scaled horizontally if topic discovery involves parallel processing of many sources.
    * Rate limits of external APIs are a key constraint.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * Careful handling of API keys for external services.
    * Validation of data retrieved from external sources (though primary content validation is later).

### 3.7. Agent Name: `DynamicUIAgent` (DUIA) - Conceptual

* **Purpose/Mission:** To translate backend-aggregated content, application state, and user context into a structured UI Definition JSON that the frontend can render. It acts as the bridge between backend data/logic and frontend presentation.
* **Note:** While documented as a separate agent for clarity of function, the initial implementation of DUIA's logic might reside as a module within the CPOA or be part of a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern within the API Gateway. The key is the *functionality* of generating the UI schema.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Receive requests for UI views, typically from CPOA, along with necessary content payloads (e.g., lists of snippets, podcast details, search results) and context (e.g., user preferences, application state).
    * Utilize defined strategies (initially programmatic construction, potentially rule-based or LLM-assisted in the future) to assemble a UI Definition JSON object according to the schema defined in `docs/architecture/Dynamic_UI_Schema.md`.
    * Map content data to appropriate UI components (e.g., text, images, lists, cards).
    * Determine and apply layout properties (flexbox, grid, spacing) to components.
    * Select and apply styling properties (colors, typography, themes) based on context or predefined rules.
    * Define interactivity (e.g., `onClick` actions) for components.
    * Ensure the generated UI schema is valid and complete for the requested view.
* **Core AI Models/Techniques Relied Upon:**
    * **Primarily Programmatic Logic (Initial):** Python functions and data structures to build the JSON schema.
    * **(Future) Rule Engines:** For more complex conditional UI adaptations.
    * **(Future - Advanced) LLMs:** Could be used to generate parts of the UI schema or suggest layout/style variations based on high-level prompts, but would require strict output validation against the UI schema.
* **Inputs:**
    * `view_identifier` (string): Specifies the target view (e.g., "landingPage", "searchResultsView").
    * `content_payload` (object/array): Data to be displayed (e.g., snippets, podcast details).
    * `user_context` (object, optional): User-specific information (preferences, auth state).
    * `application_state` (object, optional): Global application state relevant to UI.
* **Outputs:**
    * To CPOA (or directly to API Gateway): A UI Definition JSON object that conforms to the schema in `docs/architecture/Dynamic_UI_Schema.md`.
* **Primary Interactions:**
    * Tasked by/Receives data from: CPOA.
    * Outputs to: CPOA (which then passes it to the API Gateway for the frontend).
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)/Success Metrics:**
    * Correctness and validity of the generated UI Definition JSON against the schema.
    * Performance: Speed of UI schema generation.
    * Adaptability: Ease with which new UI components or view types can be supported.
    * Consistency: Ensuring generated UIs are consistent in style and behavior where intended.
* **Error Scenarios & Handling:**
    * Missing or invalid input data from CPOA: Return an error state or a fallback UI schema.
    * Internal errors during programmatic construction: Log errors, potentially return a standardized error UI schema.
    * (Future - LLM) LLM failing to produce valid schema: Fallback to a default/template-based programmatic construction for that view or component.
* **Scalability Considerations:**
    * If implemented as a module within CPOA, scales with CPOA.
    * If a separate service, needs to be scalable according to the rate of UI generation requests.
    * Efficiency of the programmatic construction logic is key.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * Ensure that any data passed into the UI schema (especially from user-generated content if ever applicable) is properly sanitized before being included in structures that might be interpreted as executable by the frontend (though the schema itself is data, not code).
* **Future Enhancements:**
    * Integration with a rules engine for more sophisticated layout/style choices.
    * Experimentation with LLMs for generating specific UI component configurations or suggesting A/B test variations for UI elements.
    * Versioning of UI generation strategies.
