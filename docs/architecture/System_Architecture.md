# System_Architecture.md

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 19, 2025

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the high-level system architecture for **Aethercast** (or your chosen app name), an AI-driven podcast application. The architecture is designed to support the dynamic, real-time generation of all content, from landing page snippets to full podcast audio streams, as described in `docs/vision/03_Podcast_App_Manifesto.md`.

The system is built around a central **Podcast Orchestrator Agent** that coordinates various specialized AI agents and services to deliver a unique, generative audio experience to the user.

3. Major Components & Technologies
Below are descriptions of the major components depicted in the architecture diagram and the likely technologies involved.

3.1. User Facing
User: The end-user interacting with the podcast application.

Frontend UI / Client App (FEND):

Description: The web application or mobile application interface that users interact with. Responsible for displaying podcast snippets, playback controls, and handling user input. It communicates with the backend via the API Gateway. For real-time audio, it will establish a connection for streaming.

Key Responsibilities:

Rendering dynamically generated UI elements (snippets, player).

Capturing user interactions (clicks, searches).

Initiating requests for podcast generation.

Handling real-time audio streaming and playback.

Displaying loading states and feedback during generation.

Potential Technologies:

Web: React, Vue, Svelte, Angular with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript.

Mobile: Swift/Objective-C (iOS), Kotlin/Java (Android), React Native, Flutter.

Real-time communication for UI updates from CPOA: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Audio Streaming: HTML5 Audio API, WebRTC, HLS/DASH.

3.2. Backend Services
API Gateway (APIGW):

Description: Single entry point for all client requests to the backend. Handles request routing, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and potentially request/response transformations.

Key Responsibilities:

Expose public endpoints for frontend interaction.

Route requests to the Central Podcast Orchestrator Agent.

Manage security and access control.

Potential Technologies: AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Google Cloud API Gateway, Kong, Tyk.

Central Podcast Orchestrator Agent (CPOA):

Description: The "brain" of the application. A sophisticated agent responsible for interpreting user requests, managing the overall workflow of podcast generation, delegating tasks to specialized AI agents, and managing state.

Key Responsibilities:

Receive and interpret requests from the API Gateway.

Maintain user session state and context.

Coordinate the sequence of operations for snippet and full podcast generation.

Delegate tasks to SnippetCraftAgent, TopicDiscoveryAgent, WebContentHarvesterAgent, PodcastScriptWeaverAgent, and VoiceForgeAgent.

Manage agent communication and data flow between agents.

Handle errors and retries in the generation pipeline.

Send UI update instructions back to the Frontend (e.g., via WebSocket through APIGW or directly).

Potential Technologies: Python (with frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, or agentic frameworks like Langchain, AutoGen), Node.js, Go. Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams) for inter-agent communication.

Specialized AI Agents:
These agents perform specific tasks in the content generation pipeline, orchestrated by the CPOA. They are likely implemented as microservices or serverless functions.

SnippetCraftAgent (SCA):

Description: Generates compelling, short-form text snippets and associated metadata (e.g., titles, potential cover art prompts) for display on the landing page. May also determine which topics are suitable for snippet generation based on input from TopicDiscoveryAgent.

Interaction: Receives tasks from CPOA, uses LLMs from AIMS, writes metadata to Data Stores.

Potential Technologies: Python, LLM SDKs (OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers).

TopicDiscoveryAgent (TDA):

Description: Identifies trending, relevant, or niche topics suitable for podcast generation. May analyze web trends, news feeds, or other sources.

Interaction: Receives tasks from CPOA, accesses External Web/APIs, writes topic data to Data Stores.

Potential Technologies: Python, web scraping libraries (Beautiful Soup, Scrapy), news API clients, NLP libraries for trend analysis.

WebContentHarvesterAgent (WCHA):

Description: Given a specific topic by the CPOA, this agent autonomously browses the web, identifies relevant sources, retrieves, and pre-processes information to form the factual basis of a podcast.

Interaction: Receives topic from CPOA, accesses External Web/APIs, provides processed content to PodcastScriptWeaverAgent (possibly via CPOA or shared storage).

Potential Technologies: Python, web scraping/browsing automation tools (Selenium, Playwright), content extraction libraries (article-parser, trafilatura).

PodcastScriptWeaverAgent (PSWA):

Description: An advanced LLM-based agent that takes processed web content, a target persona/style, and the podcast topic to write an engaging, coherent,
